Max, the Chef de Cuisine, and Mathieu, the permaculture gardener, together sublimate the vegetables and aromatics from the garden. If you private the entire Eco-Domaine, the restaurant can be utilised for your wedding reception and you can enjoy an al-fresco ceremony and cocktail reception in the gardens.\nThe 22 rooms and apartments all have a sea or garden view and offer you a unique setting, combining the charms of the countryside and those of the seaside. You will be received in a warm and family atmosphere by the fireplace in winter, or on the flowered terrace in summer. The following morning, enjoy breakfast by the fire and in summer, relax after your special day by the pool or on the terrace.\nDiscover the charms of this wild coast, the old port and the numerous activities and tourist attractions in the area. The ocean and nature have taken possession of this domain bathed by spray and greenery. Throughout the seasons, the garden, vineyards and pastures show a new face that is both authentic, mysterious and generous.\nThe apartments are equipped for handicapped individuals. The entire estate has easy access; do not hesitate to contact our team members regarding your needs.\nFor your photos, enjoy the backdrop of the walled vegetable garden, the flowered alleys lined with pear trees cut in cordon frames the flowerbeds of vegetables intended for the kitchen of the Auberge. Terraces paved or grassed, flowers of rosebushes, clematis, perennial plants and partitions of wicker, ensure the transition between the building and the surrounding gardens. Behind the sunset terrace, the swimming pool and the pond planted with water lilies are spaces conducive to relaxation.\nRent the reception room (200 m\u00b2) and the 4 apartments (18 beds) from 3 500\u20ac - you can choose from one of three recommended caterers.\nOr, if you wish to have this venue all to yourself, you can privatise the entire Eco-Domaine from Saturday at midday until Sunday at 11AM from 10 900\u20ac . The team onsite will look after your event.\nPlease do get in touch for more information.", "images": ["https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/media-56629838-008_watermarked.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/media-56629838-009_watermarked.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/media-56629838-010_watermarked.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/fa_ade-r_sidence-4.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/161901923_10158968761401390_7973461629978451557_n.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/131922823_10158754826091390_4274444055573104633_n.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/161378827_10158968761406390_9126214971121331787_n.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/155948523_10158936384186390_1977540055010299767_n.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/158551054_10158949420001390_7174014142854582992_n.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/159038122_10158949420021390_4733084318680517916_n.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/bord-de-mer.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/piscine-2.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/fontaine_bretons_lephotographedudimanchebd-33.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/fontaine_bretons_lephotographedudimanchebd-26.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/fontaine_bretons_lephotographedudimanchebd-71.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/fontaine_bretons_lephotographedudimanchebd-76.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/fontaine_bretons_lephotographedudimanchebd-90.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/fontaine_bretons_lephotographedudimanchebd-94.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/la_fontaine_aux_bretons_patrick_gerard_hd_1_.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/la_fontaine_aux_bretons_patrick_gerard_hd_4_.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/la_fontaine_aux_bretons_patrick_gerard_hd_6_.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/fontaine_bretons_lephotographedudimanchebd-103.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/img_4069.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/img_3909.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/img_3898.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/img_0524.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/mise_en_lumi_re_2.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/salle_de_r_ception_4.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/salle_de_r_ception_3.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/photo_d_co_florale_et_menu.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/fontaine_bretons_lephotographedudimanchebd-51.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/media-56629838-002_watermarked.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/media-56629838-005_watermarked.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/media-56629838-007_watermarked.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/media-56629838-008_watermarked.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/media-56629838-009_watermarked.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/media-56629838-010_watermarked.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/fa_ade-r_sidence-4.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/161901923_10158968761401390_7973461629978451557_n.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/375/large/131922823_10158754826091390_4274444055573104633_n.jpg"], "additional_info": "FEATURES\nSwimming pool\nBeach nearby\nInternet access\nBaby friendly (cots, changing facilities)\nPet friendly\nDisabled access\nMaid service\nTennis court\nHotel recommendation list\nRecommended suppliers list available\nRecommended caterer\nNearest Airport"}
