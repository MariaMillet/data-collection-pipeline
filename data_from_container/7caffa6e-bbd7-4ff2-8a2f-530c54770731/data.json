{"name": "The Elegant Chateau of Sarthe", "location": "Pays de la Loire", "guests": "120 guests", "sleeps": "Sleeps 27", "from": "\u20ac From 15,000", "timestamp": 1669375115.930536, "description": "DESCRIPTION\nThis fifteenth century chateau started life as a small domaine before being transformed into the grand building you see today with the agricultural estate and the \u201c Famille de la Rivi\u00e8re\u201d transforming it into a majestic ch\u00e2teau in the seventeenth century. The garden is a marvel that oscillates between an old-fashioned organic vegetable garden , a relaxing pool area, a marvelous rose garden that leads you to the recently renovated Orangery.\nBlend chateau and countryside for an unforgettable event:\nAt the heart of a park, a true haven of peace, enjoy almost one hundred hectares, or woods, paths, meadows, rose gardens, pond, streams and canals which have shaped the since the 17th century.\nIdeally located less than an hour from Paris by TGV, and at the crossroads of several cities, namely: Nantes, Rennes, Tours, Caen, Rouen ... the Ch\u00e2teau, a listed historic monument, is an enchanting place to make your wedding day dreams come true.\nFor an inside reception, the Room of Mirrors, with its mirrors and chandeliers reflected in it, offers you a setting for your wedding worthy of a princess.\nThe chateau has its own private chapel where you can have either a blessing or a secular ceremony and feel the magic of your commitment in a truly special and historical setting.\nThe privatization of the hotel, equipped with all the high-end comforts, will allow you to relax and spend time with your family and guests.\nThe large common areas (over 300m2) of the castle have been the subject of a refined restoration and it is possible to host events all year round.\nOur mirror room, renovated in a baroque spirit which was close to the heart to the mistress of the chateau, is an extraordinary, fabulous and unique space. Imagine a very high ceiling (about 6 metres) and a space where the large windows are each reflected in a mirror, thus creating an effect of depth where the chandeliers reflect light and beauty.\nThe other lounges (three spaces in a row) are decorated in warm colours and wood, which will offer you a different atmosphere.\nOutside, the large esplanade will allow you to organise an elegant cocktail party and its view of the park will provide a rural and idyllic setting.\nPrivatization:\nDuring your wedding, our spaces will be completely privatized and will be exclusively dedicated to you.\nNewly opened, our hotel, located in the guest wing of the Marquis de Samson, will offer you top-of-the-range accommodation for around 28 people. All have been tastefully decorated by the hostess, who was inspired by old engravings to create different decorations in each of the rooms while showing all the styles and the French art of living that reigns at the Ch\u00e2teau. In the bathrooms, black or white marble, onyx or travertine are in the spotlight. Modern comfort has not been forgotten, and all the rooms have top-of-the-range bedding, air conditioning, mini-bar, wi-fi and television.\nFor other accommodation near the castle, hotels or guest rooms can be recommended by our team.\nFor weddings:\nWe do not impose a caterer, but we can offer you high quality service providers with the assurance of refined, fast and discreet service.\nThey will provide you with tailor-made support to make your wedding unique and unforgettable.\nFor your other receptions, family celebrations, anniversaries or vow renewals, our wide choice of service providers can help you create \"turnkey\" so that your reception does not look like no other. Please do get in touch for more information and we will be more than happy to help.", "images":
