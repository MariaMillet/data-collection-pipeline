Inside the courtyard, two lodgings were created: the feudal lodge in the 13th century and the Renaissance lodge in the 15th century. The keep disappeared during the Renaissance to be replaced by a main building. The castle therefore has two parts, one medieval and the other pre-Renaissance.\nThe Renaissance building was completed by 1515. Leaning against the surrounding wall, it is built at right angles to the wall only. Its fa\u00e7ade facing out to the courtyard has two wings arranged on either side of the tower of honour with an octagonal layout which houses the staircase. The Italian influence is clearly demonstrated by the imperial domed roof, which supports an abundance of carved decoration.\nThis rural moated castle is surrounded by fields and woodlands, creating a romantic backdrop for photos and a serene and relaxed ambience for your event. The water gardens date from the end of the 16th century, when the two Renaissance pavilions were built to mark the entrance to the gardens. The garden has evolved over the centuries as fashions have changed, but it has always kept its core structure. Abandoned following the Revolution, the castle was restored around 1855 and the grounds were transformed into a landscaped park. In 1985, contemporary gardens were created around the Renaissance water gardens and the old structure was restored.\nWater is omnipresent in the castle grounds where it plays an essential role. The remarkable and very elaborate hydraulic system inherited from the Middle Ages is still in use, and weirs and shovels regulate the flow of water throughout its course. Many ornamental trees planted in the middle of the last century are still visible today in the park, which has many and beautiful species of trees such as cypress trees planted on the edge of moats and canals, century-old oaks and gigantic plane trees. This creation of the contemporary gardens gave the castle an environment it was truly worthy of, enhancing the contrast between the long perspectives of the canals and the closed gardens.\nFor your wedding day you are able to hire one of the beautiful reception rooms including the Salle des Archers, the gardens, the interior courtyard or choose to privatise the entire Ch\u00e2teau for your special day.\nThe Salle des Archers, is a vaulted room dating from the 17th century; it is located on the left when entering the courtyard, opposite the fa\u00e7ade of the Logis Renaissance, and is illuminated in the evening. Its surface area is approximately 207 m2,and is partly covered with a level carpet, the other part has a wooden floor of 5m X 8m to serve as a dance floor. This room can accommodate up to 200 seated guests and is available to hire from 1650 euros.\nThe price includes the rental of the \"la Salle des archers\" which is the main room where the event can take place, \"la Salle des \u00e9quipages\" where the caterer can work, \"la Sellerie\" which can be used by the children or can be used as a cloakroom and finally an open-air cocktail party in the chateau courtyard.\nSeveral other options are also available including the possibility to reserve an additional space for a marquee or platform in the castle's courtyard or in the park as well as lighting installations and a guided tour of the castle for your guests.
