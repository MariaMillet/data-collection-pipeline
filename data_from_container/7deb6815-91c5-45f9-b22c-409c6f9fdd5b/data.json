Enjoy a game of pool, a day of fishing, and relax in the jacuzzi or by the hunt room fireplace. You are at home throughout the estate with the freedom to organize your reception to your liking!\nWe are a family run business who have been at the Chateau since 1928 when the family purchased the estate as a hunting property. We have since decided to rent our family home for weddings, as well as create a microbrewery on the site of our watermill so there is a lot of history to this wedding venue making it more of a home from home.\nWe strive to understand your needs so we can offer you a variety of options that cater to your vision.\nWhether you are planning an intimate or grand wedding, we have everything you need. We can accommodate up to 220 people in our 252 m2 tent, which has lighting and wooden floor, tables and chairs (available from end of May until mid October). You can then have the after party in our barn turned dance hall which is fully equipped with a dance floor and a DJ sound system.\nContact us ! We are happy to talk about how we can best accommodate you.", "images": ["https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/stephanie-barry-354.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/stephanie-barry-483-1.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/stephanie-barry-484.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/20157322_1535217326541337_7286486175816433959_o-2.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/miserai_drone.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/stephanie-barry-333-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/miserai_autumn.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/plateforme.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/photo_groupe.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/stephanie-barry-367-1-1-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/wedding-tent.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/20116951_1535220836540986_7289471467851323147_o.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/20121224_1535220199874383_215595529838280653_o.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/20232417_1535220019874401_7013982186405342883_o-1.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/20121480_1535218566541213_8080425041506457619_o-1.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/20157128_1535219873207749_9145185345668097879_o-2.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/brasserie-inside.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/brasserie.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/49012422_790386984693433_7142180646427820032_o.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/dsc_7693-1.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/dsc_8613.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/img_e13111-1-960x300_c.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/img_e13131.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/pistededanse.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/stephanie-barry-133.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/stephanie-barry-354.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/stephanie-barry-483-1.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/stephanie-barry-484.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/20157322_1535217326541337_7286486175816433959_o-2.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/miserai_drone.jpg", "https://www.frenchweddingvenues.com/userfiles/venue/183/large/stephanie-barry-333-1024x683.jpg"], "additional_info": "FEATURES\nInternet access\nBaby friendly (cots, changing facilities)\nDisabled access\nHot tub\nSwimming pool\nHotel recommendation list\nMarquee available on site\nChapel on site\nRecommended caterer\nRecommended suppliers list available\nCamping"}
