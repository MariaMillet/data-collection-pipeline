The Chateau is a place to dream, an exceptional place to celebrate the start of your married lives together - your guests will remember it for years to come!\nThe family home of the Duchess of Magenta and her children, you will immediately feel the welcoming atmosphere of the Chateau. There are many different spaces which are suited for wedding receptions and the team are flexible to accommodate each couple's requests. \nThe castle is built with large towers and four different facades, all surrounded by a moat with an exceptional Renaissance interior courtyard. The vegetable garden is classified as a Remarkable Garden. It is a magnificent castle but at the same time a family home, and it is this combination that makes it unique. Inspiring but at the same time very lively, the chateau is a grandiose setting, romantic at will, which is characterised by its warmth and hospitality.\nWith one of the biggest reception rooms in the area, it is possible to host up to 300 people seated for the wedding in the converted stables of the house. Meanwhile, the Orangerie is more suited to 120 seated guests and is a light and beautiful space for a wedding reception.\nThere is no curfew or noise restrictions, meaning you can party to the small hours - often the DJ will keep everyone on the dancefloor until 5am and this can be extended if needed!\n10 bedrooms are available for wedding guests, which can sleep 27 people and there are also further dormitory style bedrooms in the village which can accommodate approximately another 30 people. We offer one night stay for our guests but unfortunatly we are unable to cater for weddings of a longer duration.\nThe Chateau works with excellent caterers for food, drink and tableware and different requests can be accommodated - for example a food truck serving freshly roasted chickens or pizzas can be parked on the grounds.\nThere is a large church in the village as well as a small chapel in the park of the house, or why not opt for a ceremony in the open air in the most beautiful courtyard in France, in the ballroom or in the Orangerie?\nCeremony - Celebrate your union during a secular ceremony on the lawn, in the Renaissance courtyard or in the Ch\u00e2teau ballroom.\nCocktail - Guests will be welcomed on the lawns around the castle, in the Renaissance courtyard or on the large terrace on the water; the Orangery can be a perfect place for cocktails nd then moving your party to the Stables for dinner and evening entertainment. The place presents a whole host of possibility for different decorations and atmospheres.\nStables - The old stables are large (400m\u00b2), one of the largest rooms in the region which allows you to hold a reception with everyone in the same room. There is room to install changing rooms, drop off gifts, receive the DJ and his equipment, entertainment or games places, a candy bar .... It is possible to set up a large marquee in front of the castle if there are a lot of guests or a small one to allow you to have, according to your imagination, a separate lounge or anything else to make your day just perfect.\nBrunch - It is possible to return the next day to the Ch\u00e2teau, in the Gardens, or to the wine estate nearby for a brunch, barbecue or picnic.\nContact us to organise your perfect day !
