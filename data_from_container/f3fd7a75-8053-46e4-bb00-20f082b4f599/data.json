Each private guest suite offers bathrooms with all its bedrooms as well as areas for relaxing and eating. Imagine privatising the entire 20 acre estate so that your guests can enjoy the forest and formal gardens; the pool and petanque rink; the banquet hall and bar as well as the family chapel and library. It is an exceptional wedding venue dating from the 16th Century which has been recently refurbished to offer 5*self-catering accommodation. Imagine the homely ambience of a boutique apart-hotel within a grand Ch\u00e2teau where each private guest suite has its own unique furniture\nand art creating individual character.\nAt this Ch\u00e2teau we host very special events from celebrity weddings to the showcasing of luxury cars. In France food and wine need little in the way of introduction, however, you will want to ensure that your guests experience the gastronomy of the Anjou-Touraine region at its best. Our Chef creates the most wonderful French cuisine to the highest possible standards using natural local ingredients. Each course is served as if you were in\nan exclusive restaurant, not at a function. We have absolutely no doubt that we offer the best catered receptions in the Loire Valley, however if you do wish to provide your own caterer then that is also absolutely fine. The Ch\u00e2teau carefully selects the finest and most suitable wines of the region within your budget to accompany your meals. Tastings of both food and wine take place during one of your planning visits to the Ch\u00e2teau. We also offer fresh seafood buffets, hog roasts and daily breakfasts of fresh local patisseries and dairy produce. Our Banquet Hall can seat up to 180 Guests in a long table format or 150 Guests with a Round Table Format (we can install a Barnum on our lawns for larger dinner groups).\nWhen booking the accommodation at the Ch\u00e2teau, it is recommended to privatise the full Chateau Estate, including the grounds, 20 Acres of Forest, Banquet Hall, `Stone Domed Roof Chapel (which can seat up to 120 guests and can cater for more with standing space), 20m Swimming Pool and formal gardens, giving you and your guests, your very own Chateau for your dream Wedding.
